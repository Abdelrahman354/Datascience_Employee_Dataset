Data Preparation:

The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot.
It then reads the employee data from a CSV file using pandas and displays the first few rows of the dataset using data.head().
The code also displays information about the dataset using data.info() and prints the column names using data.columns.
Data Cleaning:

Several functions are defined to clean and transform specific columns in the dataset.
The "Marital Status" column is standardized to have only two categories: "married" and "single".
The "Income" column is processed to remove dollar signs and commas, and then converted to numeric values.
The "Children" column is converted to integer values.
The "Purchased Bike" and "Home Owner" columns are transformed to binary values (1 for "Yes" and 0 for "No").
The "Gender" column is standardized to have only two categories: "male" and "female".
Missing values in the dataset are filled with the mode (most frequent value) of each column.
Data Analysis:

Various questions are answered using the cleaned dataset:
Average income of the employees
Percentage of employees earning more than $50,000
Percentage of employees who have purchased a bike
Most common occupation
Number of employees with no children
Average number of cars owned by employees
Number of employees living in the Pacific region
Average age of employees
Percentage of employees with a commute distance of 5-10 miles and owning a home
Most common commute distance
Most common gender
Average income of male employees
Average income of female employees
Percentage of male and female employees
Number of employees with 2 or more cars and income less than $50,000
Percentage of individuals who are home owners and have purchased a bike
Highest income in the dataset
Number of employees with a partial college education
Number of employees over 50 years old
Percentage of male employees over 50 years old
Number of employees with a skilled manual occupation
IDs of rows with the highest income
Number of employees with a graduate degree
Average income in Europe and the Pacific region
Most common marital status
Average income for singles and married individuals
Data Visualization:

The code includes several visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot:
Bar chart showing the mean income based on the number of cars owned
Box plots for income and age distributions
Heatmap showing the count of employees based on education and occupation
Count plot for occupation distribution
Data Export:

The cleaned and analyzed dataset is saved to a new CSV file named "pafter.csv".
Machine Learning (Classification):

Additional code is provided for a machine learning task using logistic regression.
The dataset is preprocessed by encoding categorical variables and splitting into training and testing sets.
A logistic regression model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.
The accuracy of the model is calculated and displayed.
Overall, this project involves loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing an employee dataset, as well as applying machine learning techniques for classification tasks. The code provides insights into the characteristics of the employees and explores relationships between different variables in the dataset.
